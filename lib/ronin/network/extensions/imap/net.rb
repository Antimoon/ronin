  # _options_ may contain the following keys:
  # <tt>:port</tt>:: The port the IMAP server is running on. Defaults to
  #                  IMAP.default_port.
  # <tt>:certs</tt>:: The path to the file containing CA certs of the server.
  # <tt>:auth</tt>:: The type of authentication to perform when connecting
  #                  to the server. May be either :login, or :cram_md5.
  # <tt>:user</tt>:: The user to authenticate as when connecting to the
  #                  server.
  # <tt>:password</tt>:: The password to authenticate with when connecting
  #                      to the server.
  # <tt>:ssl</tt>:: Indicates wether or not to use SSL when connecting to
  #                 the server.
